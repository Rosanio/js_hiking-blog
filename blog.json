    "body": "One of the tallest and most distinct landmarks in the Columbia River Gorge, and perhaps one of the most difficult to climb on the Washington side, due to it's long 15 mile round trip ascent. This has long been a popular climb, due to the the inviting nature of it's distinct, triangular rocky face, it's proximity to the PCT for through-hikers, and the magnificent 360-degree view from the summit.
